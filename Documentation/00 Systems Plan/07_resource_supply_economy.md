# 7. Resource & Supply Economy

**Purpose:** Manages all currencies and materials. Creates the risk/reward tension that drives mission selection and planning.

**Responsibilities:**
- Tracks multiple resource types (e.g., general currency, tech components, medical supplies, ammunition/fuel, orbital intel points).
- Resources are consumed by: deploying squads, upgrading units, unlocking tech, and certain mission prerequisites.
- Resources are earned by: completing missions (story and generic), optional objectives, and efficient mission outcomes.
- Resource scarcity is a key lever — especially on the Defector path in Act 3, where access to resources is deliberately constrained.

**Resource Types (generic, names TBD):**
| Resource | Use |
|---|---|
| General Currency | Unit upgrades, loadout purchases |
| Tech Components | Research / tech unlock prerequisites |
| Medical Supplies | Unit injury recovery |
| Fuel / Logistics | Mission deployment cost (scales with mission size) |
| Intel Points | Unlocks optional objectives, mission reconnaissance |
