# Part 8: Setting Up the Scene

Now let's create a scene with the GameStateManager.

## Step 8.1: Create the Manager GameObject

1. Create a new scene or use your existing main scene
2. Create an empty GameObject: `GameObject > Create Empty`
3. Name it `GameStateManager`
4. Add the `GameStateManager` component to it
5. Save the scene

## Step 8.2: Test the System

1. Enter Play Mode
2. Open the Game State Debug window (`Window > Game Debug > Game State Debug`)
3. Try these actions:
   - Add test units in the Squad tab
   - Modify resources in the Resources tab
   - Make moral choices in the Moral tab
   - Advance the act in the Campaign tab
4. Verify all changes are reflected in the debug window
